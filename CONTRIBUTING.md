## Development

1. Install git hooks: `make hooks`
2. Run the full gate locally: `make verify` (lint + pytest + gitleaks + trufflehog)

## Proposal Process
Before we introduce significant changes to the project we want to gather feedback
from the community to ensure that we progress in the right direction before we
develop and release big changes. Significant changes include for example:

* proposing breaking changes
* changing the behavior of the service significantly
* adding new authentication or authorization flows

For large changes, open a discussion or issue first before submitting a PR.
